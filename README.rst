Code Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

The CHANS repository is a collection of generalized submodules for modeling 
coupled human and natural systems (CHANS). Construction of the CHANS repository 
is supported as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation (NSF) 
Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE) grant `(OISE 
0729709) <http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu>`_ and an NSF Coupled Natural and Human 
         Systems (CNH) grant `(award number 1212183) 
         <http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1212183&WT.z_pims_id=13681>`_.  

Development of the repository is in progress, some modules are not yet 
complete. This page will be updated as development continues

See the `Space-Time Analysis of Complex Systems (STACS) Group website
<http://complexity.sdsu.edu>`_  for more information.
